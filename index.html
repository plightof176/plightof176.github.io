<br><strong>We still have to pay 3 times penalty on property tax</strong> (O/G/07/04412481 to O/G/07/04412656)<strong>???</strong></p>

<p>(1.) 176 flats of Ganga Constella Co-operative Housing Society, Kharadi, Pune are charged with 3 times property tax due to delay in issuance of Completion Certificate by PMC. The tax amount with penalty for flats as small as size 740 sq fts are in the range Rs. 111117 to Rs. 174381 for 5 years.</p>

<p>(2.) Completion Certificates for all these flats were delayed due to issues between the builder and PMC. Flat owners are not at fault for delay in issuance of completion certificates.</p>

<p>(3.) Policy for 3 times penalty on property tax was discarded/removed by civic body in 2014. But these 176 unlucky middle class people were still charged.</p>

<p>(4.) Builder is let go by paying a very small penalty per flat under an amnesty scheme mentioned in <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Amnesty-plan-for-regularisation-of-buildings-without-occupancy-certificates/articleshow/51048984.cms">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Amnesty-plan-for-regularisation-of-buildings-without-occupancy-certificates/articleshow/51048984.cms</a></p>

<p>(5.) Property Ids of these 176 flats range from <strong>O/G/07/04412481</strong> to <strong>O/G/07/04412656</strong>. Check the tax bills at <a href="https://propertytax.punecorporation.org/prop_tax_bill.aspx">https://propertytax.punecorporation.org/prop_tax_bill.aspx</a>.</p>

<p>(6.) Every month, PMC has also started charging interest on the penalty and the tax</p>

<p>(7.) Numerous applications are submitted to Pune Municipal Commissioner, Deputy Municipal Commissioner A &amp; C Taxes - Pune, Assistant Municipal Commissioner Office, Nagar Road (Vadgaon Sheri) - Pune. We are yet to get any relaxation on this huge financial burden on us.</p>

<p>If the builder has been given amnesty scheme for delay in getting the completion certificate, why are sincere tax paying citizens who have paid hefty stamp duty, registration fee to State of Maharashtra for purchasing these flats and who work in IT/software industry are harassed? </p>

<p>If the builders can get amnesty scheme, why can't the common man?</p>

<p><strong>We request the Chief Minister of the state of Maharashtra and Pune Municipal Corporation members and office bearers to intervene and give us relief from penalty and interest amount. We are ready to pay the regular tax amount for all the years since possession of the flats.</strong></p>
